# Firmware stubs

This folder contains template code for ESP32 firmware demonstrating:
- How to read sensors (placeholder)
- How to call tiny ML inference (placeholder)
- How to schedule deep-sleep using esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup

**Note**: These are templates only. They do not include TFLite Micro integration.
See TensorFlow Lite Micro docs to embed `training/models/tiny_model.tflite` into the firmware.
